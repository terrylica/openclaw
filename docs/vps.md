# VPS hosting

This hub links to the supported VPS/hosting guides and explains how cloud
deployments work at a high level.

## Pick a provider

- **Railway** (one‑click + browser setup): [Railway](/install/railway)
- **Northflank** (one‑click + browser setup): [Northflank](/install/northflank)
- **Oracle Cloud (Always Free)**: [Oracle](/platforms/oracle) — $0/month (Always Free, ARM; capacity/signup can be finicky)
- **Fly.io**: [Fly.io](/install/fly)
- **Hetzner (Docker)**: [Hetzner](/install/hetzner)
- **GCP (Compute Engine)**: [GCP](/install/gcp)
- **exe.dev** (VM + HTTPS proxy): [exe.dev](/install/exe-dev)
- **AWS (EC2/Lightsail/free tier)**: works well too. Video guide:

## How cloud setups work

- The **Gateway runs on the VPS** and owns state + workspace.
- You connect from your laptop/phone via the **Control UI** or **Tailscale/SSH**.
- Treat the VPS as the source of truth and **back up** the state + workspace.
- Secure default: keep the Gateway on loopback and access it via SSH tunnel or Tailscale Serve.
  If you bind to `lan`/`tailnet`, require `gateway.auth.token` or `gateway.auth.password`.

Remote access: [Gateway remote](/gateway/remote)  
Platforms hub: [Platforms](/platforms)

## Shared company agent on a VPS

This is a valid setup when the users are in one trust boundary (for example one company team), and the agent is business-only.

- Keep it on a dedicated runtime (VPS/VM/container + dedicated OS user/accounts).
- Do not sign that runtime into personal Apple/Google accounts or personal browser/password-manager profiles.
- If users are adversarial to each other, split by gateway/host/OS user.

Security model details: [Security](/gateway/security)

## Using nodes with a VPS

You can keep the Gateway in the cloud and pair **nodes** on your local devices
(Mac/iOS/Android/headless). Nodes provide local screen/camera/canvas and `system.run`
capabilities while the Gateway stays in the cloud.

Docs: [Nodes](/nodes), [Nodes CLI](/cli/nodes)

## Startup tuning for small VMs and ARM hosts

If CLI commands feel slow on low-power VMs (or ARM hosts), enable Node's module compile cache:

```bash
grep -q 'NODE_COMPILE_CACHE=/var/tmp/openclaw-compile-cache' ~/.bashrc || cat >> ~/.bashrc <<'EOF'
export NODE_COMPILE_CACHE=/var/tmp/openclaw-compile-cache
mkdir -p /var/tmp/openclaw-compile-cache
export OPENCLAW_NO_RESPAWN=1
EOF
source ~/.bashrc
```

- `NODE_COMPILE_CACHE` improves repeated command startup times.
- `OPENCLAW_NO_RESPAWN=1` avoids extra startup overhead from a self-respawn path.
- First command run warms cache; subsequent runs are faster.
- For Raspberry Pi specifics, see [Raspberry Pi](/platforms/raspberry-pi).

### systemd tuning checklist (optional)

For VM hosts using `systemd`, consider:

- Add service env for stable startup path:
  - `OPENCLAW_NO_RESPAWN=1`
  - `NODE_COMPILE_CACHE=/var/tmp/openclaw-compile-cache`
- Keep restart behavior explicit:
  - `Restart=always`
  - `RestartSec=2`
  - `TimeoutStartSec=90`
- Prefer SSD-backed disks for state/cache paths to reduce random-I/O cold-start penalties.

Example:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit openclaw
```

```ini
[Service]
Environment=OPENCLAW_NO_RESPAWN=1
Environment=NODE_COMPILE_CACHE=/var/tmp/openclaw-compile-cache
Restart=always
RestartSec=2
TimeoutStartSec=90
```
